=head1 NAME

RackMan - Main interface for accessing a RackTables database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RackMan;
    use RackMan::Config;

    my $config  = RackMan::Config->new(-file => "/etc/rack.conf");
    my $rackman = RackMan->new({ config => $config });


=head1 DESCRIPTION

RackMan is a set of Perl modules for fetching information from a
L<RackTables|http://racktables.org/> database. The distribution
also includes some commands that show how to use the RackMan API.

=over 

=item *
rack is a program that generates the configuration files for the
given RackObject, and talk with the corresponding devices to set
them up accordingly.

=item *
cisco-status is a program that connects to a Cisco switch to list
the devices connected to it, with additionnal information resolved
from RackTables.

=item *
cfengine-tags is a program that generates tag files for Cfengine.

=back
    
A technical presentation of this software was made at the French
Perl Workshop 2012: L<http://maddingue.org/conferences/fpw-2012/rackman/>

Note: This software was written to perform very specific tasks.
Although it was tried to keep it generic, it certainly isn't, and
the documentation is very rough. There's a more comprehensive
tutorial (only in French for now) in pod/RackMan/Manual.fr.pod

This C<RackMan> module provides the main interface for accessing a
RackTables database.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 connection

Connect to the RackTables database using the parameters from the
configuration file.


=head2 device

Alias for C<device_by_name()>.


=head2 device_by_id

Try to find and return the RackObject with the given ID.


=head2 device_by_name

Try to find and return the RackObject with the given name.


=head2 get_scm

Return a RackMan::SCM object corresponding to the tool selected by the
configuration file and command line options.


=head2 process

Process and execute an action as given from the command line.

Arguments are expected to be:

=over

=item *

the action name

=item *

optional action options, as a plain hash

=item *

RackObject name

=back


=head2 error

Class method to print an error and exit.


=head2 error_n

Class method to print an error, preceded by a newline, and exit.


=head2 set_status

Class method to set the return status of the program.


=head2 status

Class method to get the return status of the program.


=head2 warning

Class method to print a warning.
