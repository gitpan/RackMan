NAME

    RackMan - Perl modules for connecting to a RackTables database


DESCRIPTION

    RackMan is a set of Perl modules for fetching information from a
    RackTables database. The distribution also includes some commands
    that show how to use the RackMan API.

    * rack is a program that generates the configuration files for the
    given RackObject, and talk with the corresponding devices to set
    them up accordingly.

    * cisco-status is a program that connects to a Cisco switch to list
    the devices connected to it, with additionnal information resolved
    from RackTables.

    * cfengine-tags is a program that generates tag files for Cfengine.

    A technical presentation of this software was made at the French
    Perl Workshop 2012:
      http://maddingue.org/conferences/fpw-2012/rackman/

    Note: This software was written to perform very specific tasks.
    Although it was tried to keep it generic, it certainly isn't, and
    the documentation is very rough. There's a more comprehensive
    tutorial (only in French for now) in pod/RackMan/Manual.fr.pod
