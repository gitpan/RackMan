rtlink - Trivial link redirecter to RackTables

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The sole purpose of this very small CGI program is to redirect to
RackTables, allowing the use of shorter parameter names in order
to work around the tight limits in some devices.

  Translation table
  -----------------
  oi  object_id
